# IPL-EDA
In this guided project, I have tried to analyze the data related to IPL matches from year 2008 to 2020. 
My aim will be to draw useful insights and look out for the major factors that help teams win the matches. 
I will be using pandas & numpy for data manipulation and matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.
